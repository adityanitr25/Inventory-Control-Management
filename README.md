**Project on Database Management System for Inventory Management System using SQL**

I have shared the database management system project report file that I used Structured Query Language (SQL) to implement. For easier comprehension, an ER-Diagram is also included in this file.

**How to Put It Into Practice:**


Install the SQL Command Line on your computer. Execute each Create Table Command individually.(Before copying the command, make sure you have eliminated all serial numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.). Use the commands listed in the PDF file to put the data into the table once it has been created.
Your undertaking is prepared!
